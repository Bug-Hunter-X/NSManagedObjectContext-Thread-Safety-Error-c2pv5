The correct way to interact with `NSManagedObjectContext` from different threads involves using the `performBlock:` or `performBlockAndWait:` methods.  This ensures that the context's operations are performed on its designated thread, preventing race conditions and data corruption.

```objectivec
// Correct: Using performBlock: to ensure thread safety
[managedObjectContext performBlock:^{ 
    NSError *error = nil;
    if (![managedObjectContext save:&error]) {
        NSLog("Error saving context: %@
", [error localizedDescription]);
    }
}];

// Alternatively, using performBlockAndWait: if you need a synchronous operation:
[managedObjectContext performBlockAndWait:^{ 
    NSError *error = nil;
    if (![managedObjectContext save:&error]) {
        NSLog("Error saving context: %@
", [error localizedDescription]);
    }
}];
```
By using these methods, you guarantee thread safety and prevent the potential for crashes or data corruption.
